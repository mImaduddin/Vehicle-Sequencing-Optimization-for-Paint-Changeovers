This project is centered on refining vehicle sequencing in an automotive paint shop to lessen paint color changeovers, which is crucial for minimizing paint waste, time, and production costs. By  organizing vehicles according to color, we can significantly cut down on how often we need to flush and change the paint, leading to reduced material costs and faster production. We’re utilizing a Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing to find the best sequences, with the genetic algorithm being particularly effective here. We’re also exploring a Machine Learning Model (Random Forest) to estimate sequence costs and aid in optimization. The notebook offers a walkthrough with visualizations.
